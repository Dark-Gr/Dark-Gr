## About
On the internet, I'm better known as **Dark**, my nickname.

I'm a brazillian hobbyist programmer but I plan to enter the career someday, I'm currently 15 years old and I've been studying programming on my own since I was 10 years old.

## Main Projects
I don't have many projects for now but the projects I'm currently working are:

* [Tekgy](https://github.com/Teekgy) - A mod for minecraft, currently at it's very start.
* [Markdown-Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/Markdown-Cheat-Sheet) - A small repository that contains all markdown formatting codes.
